                <p>The Women Techsters initiative, an initiative of Tech4Dev is aimed at bridging the digital and technology knowledge divide between men and women as well as ensuring equal access to opportunities for all. We are empowering girls and women across Africa with varying degrees of digital, deep tech and soft skills required within the technology ecosystem. Our objective is to grow and support an army of tech empowered girls and women across Africa who will have equal access to decent job opportunities as well as build and scale their ideas into tech-enabled businesses and deep tech startups, which will aid Africaâ€™s economic growth.</p>

              <p>Technology for Social Change and Development Initiative (Tech4Dev) is a non-profit social enterprise established in 2016 that creates access to decent work and opportunities for Africans through digital skills empowerment and advocacy.

              Our vision is to equip Africans with digital and life skills that foster economic prosperity, financial freedom, and sustainable development, contributing immensely to the tech ecosystem and the economy of the world at large, starting with Africa.

              We believe in the efficacy of digital literacy as a tool for empowerment and development and commit fully to creating opportunities for people, especially those in underserved communities, through digital skills.</p>

              <p>Team Intel comprises a team of 11 ladies led by Blessing Ejogbamu, learning frontend software development alongside other extraordinary ladies in the Womentechster's fellowship class of 2023. We are a beneficiary of the women testers fellowship, an initiative of Tech4dev. Though given the name Intel, we took it as an abbreviation for Intelligence, so we are a team of intelligent, like-minded, and goal-oriented ladies, learning and collaborating to build unique projects. Thanks to the Organizers of this program, our Executive director, Mrs. Olad, our fantastic facilitators, Mr. Innocent and Mr. Ayodele, and our sponsors, Microsoft, ISDB, Prunudge, and others not mentioned here, for making this a reality. </p>
